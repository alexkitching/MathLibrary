# C++ MathLibrary

**1st Year University Project** <br/>
**Semester 2** <br/>
**Programming and Mathematics for Games**

This Library was produced alongside and for use with the TinyTanks Project.

I was tasked with creating a Vector and Matrix Math Library as well as various Collision Detection Methods.

 **Features:** <br/>
 Vector Classes and Functions <br/>
 Matrix Classes and Functions <br/>
 Collision Detection Algorithms (AABB, GJK) <br/>
 
 **Skills Demonstrated:** <br/>
 Vector and Matrix Math <br/>
 Const Correctness <br/>
